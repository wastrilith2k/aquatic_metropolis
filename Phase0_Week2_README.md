## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Terrain System Enhancement (Days 1-2)
```lua
-- Enhanced WorldGenerator structure
WorldGenerator = {
    TerrainGenerator = {},    -- Improved terrain creation
    BiomeManager = {},        -- Biome boundary system
    EnvironmentManager = {},  -- Lighting and atmosphere
    PlacementManager = {}     -- Procedural asset placement
}
```

### Phase 2: Procedural Placement (Days 3-4)
- Region-based spawning grid system
- Density maps for natural resource distribution
- Collision detection for placement validation
- Noise-based variation in placement patterns

### Phase 3: Visual Polish (Days 5-6)
- Animated resource nodes with TweenService
- Enhanced underwater particle effects
- Improved lighting with depth-based color shifts
- Better material properties for realism

### Phase 4: Framework Preparation (Day 7)
- Streaming system foundation
- Performance monitoring enhancements
- Object pooling implementation
- Scalability testing

## 🎮 Enhanced Player Experience

### Visual Improvements
1. **Dynamic Resource Nodes**:
   - Kelp gently sways with underwater currents
   - Pearls emit soft, pulsing glow
   - Rocks have varied textures and sizes

2. **Atmospheric Enhancements**:
   - Depth-based lighting (darker at greater depths)
   - Floating particle effects (bubbles, sediment)
   - Improved water caustic lighting effects

3. **Terrain Variety**:
   - Rolling seafloor with height variation
   - Rocky outcroppings with natural placement
   - Sandy areas with texture variation

### Technical Enhancements
1. **Improved Performance**:
   - Object pooling for resource nodes
   - Distance-based detail reduction
   - Optimized particle systems

2. **Scalable Systems**:
   - Region-based world management
   - Streaming preparation for larger worlds
   - Efficient memory usage patterns

## 🧪 Week 2 Testing Objectives

### Visual Quality Testing
- [ ] Resource animations play smoothly at 30+ FPS
- [ ] Lighting effects enhance underwater atmosphere
- [ ] Terrain generation completes within 45 seconds
- [ ] No visual artifacts or rendering issues

### Performance Validation

## 🔄 Integration with Week 1 Systems

### Backward Compatibility
- All Week 1 save data remains valid
- Existing resource spawning enhanced, not replaced
- Player progression and inventory systems unchanged
- Performance monitoring continues with enhanced metrics

### Enhanced Features
- Resource spawning now uses procedural placement
- World generation creates more varied underwater landscape
- UI remains the same but with improved visual feedback
- Save system unchanged but monitors new performance metrics

## 🚀 Setup Instructions for Week 2

### Updating from Week 1
1. **Backup Current Progress**: Export place file as backup
2. **Update Scripts**: Replace/add new scripts from Week 2 package
3. **Clear Old Resources**: Delete existing ResourceNodes folder
4. **Restart Server**: Allow new world generation to run

### New Installation
1. Copy all files from `src/` to Roblox Studio services
2. Run the game - enhanced world generation will begin
3. Test resource gathering with improved visuals
4. Verify performance remains stable

## 🐛 Known Week 2 Limitations

- Biome system is framework only (full implementation in Week 5)
- Advanced procedural features limited to basic patterns
- Animation complexity kept simple for performance
- Streaming system is preparatory framework only

## 🎯 Looking Ahead: Week 3 Preview

### Week 3 Objectives (Resource System Enhancement)
- Advanced crafting interface implementation
- Tool durability and upgrade systems
- Enhanced resource properties and rarity
- Player progression tracking

### Preparation Items
- Resource animation system will support tool interactions
- Terrain system ready for biome expansion
- Performance framework ready for more complex features
