## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Resource Node Enhancement (Days 1-2)
```lua
-- Enhanced ResourceNode structure
ResourceNode = {
    id = "unique_identifier",
    type = "Kelp" | "Rock" | "Pearl",
    rarity = "Common" | "Uncommon" | "Rare",
    harvestDifficulty = 1.0, -- Tool requirement multiplier
    respawnTime = 30, -- Base seconds to respawn
    currentState = "Available" | "Harvested" | "Respawning",
    lastHarvested = tick(),
    harvestedBy = userId,
    bonusChance = 0.1, -- Chance for bonus resources
    toolRequirement = nil -- Optional specific tool needed
}
```

### Phase 2: Crafting System Implementation (Days 3-4)
- Server-side CraftingSystem for recipe validation and processing
- Client-side crafting interface with real-time feedback
- Progress tracking with success/failure states
- Integration with existing CraftingData recipes

### Phase 3: Tool & Stamina Systems (Days 5-6)
- Tool durability tracking with visual indicators
- Stamina system affecting harvesting speed
- Tool effect bonuses (speed, bonus resources, special abilities)
- Player progression tracking

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Day 7)
- Integrate all systems with existing Week 2 infrastructure
- Performance optimization for complex interactions
- Enhanced UI feedback and visual effects
- Comprehensive testing and balancing

## 🎮 Enhanced Player Experience

### Advanced Harvesting
1. **Tool-Based Harvesting**:
   - Bare hands: Slow harvesting, low success rate
   - Kelp Harvester: 50% faster kelp gathering
   - Stone Hammer: Better rock breaking with bonus resources
   - Pearl Diving Net: Double pearl find rate

2. **Stamina Management**:
   - Harvesting consumes stamina based on resource difficulty
   - Low stamina reduces harvesting speed and success rate
   - Stamina regenerates over time or with rest areas
   - Advanced players have better stamina efficiency

3. **Resource Rarity System**:
   - Common resources (80%): Basic materials for everyday crafting
   - Uncommon resources (15%): Better materials for improved tools
   - Rare resources (5%): Special materials for advanced crafting

### Comprehensive Crafting
1. **Interactive Crafting Stations**:
   - Click-to-open crafting interface with available recipes
   - Real-time ingredient validation and feedback

   - Visual and audio feedback for completed crafts

2. **Tool Progression**:
   ```lua
   -- Tool Progression Example
   Basic Tools (Tier 1):
   - Kelp Harvester: 3 Kelp → 50 uses, 1.5x speed
   - Stone Hammer: 2 Rock → 40 uses, 1.3x speed
   
   Advanced Tools (Tier 2):
   - Reinforced Harvester: 5 Kelp + 1 Rare Coral → 100 uses, 2.0x speed
