# AquaticMetropolis - Phase 0 Week 1 Implementation

## 🎯 MVP Beta Foundation Complete

### What's Been Implemented

#### ✅ Core Systems (Week 1)
- **GameManager**: Central system coordinator with performance monitoring
- **PlayerDataManager**: Robust save system with triple redundancy  
- **WorldGenerator**: Simplified underwater world generation

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Roblox Studio Setup
1. Create new Place in Roblox Studio
2. Copy all files from `src/` to corresponding Roblox services:
   - `ServerScriptService/` → ServerScriptService
   - `ReplicatedStorage/` → ReplicatedStorage  
   - `StarterGui/` → StarterGui

### 2. Required Folder Structure
The scripts will auto-create these folders, but you can create them manually:
```
Workspace/
├── ResourceNodes/
│   ├── Kelp/
│   ├── Rock/
│   └── Pearl/
├── EnvironmentalAssets/
│   └── AmbientFish/
└── PlayerBuildings/
```

### 3. Testing the MVP

#### Server Console Output
When you run the game, you should see:
```
🌊 AquaticMetropolis MVP Beta v1.0 Starting...
⚙️ Initializing world...
💧 Water volume created
🏖️ Sandy seafloor created
🪨 Rocky outcroppings added
✅ Basic terrain generation complete
🎨 Setting up underwater environment...
✅ Resources spawned: Kelp: 18, Rock: 12, Pearl: 6
🎉 AquaticMetropolis server is ready for players!
```

#### Player Experience
1. **Join Game**: Underwater world with glowing resources
2. **Harvest Resources**: Click on Kelp (green), Rocks (gray), Pearls (white)
3. **View Inventory**: Resources appear in bottom-left inventory panel
4. **Resource Counters**: Top-right shows current resource counts
5. **Tutorial Hints**: Purple tutorial bar explains mechanics

### 4. Performance Metrics
- **Target FPS**: 30+ (with automatic quality reduction if needed)
- **Max Players**: 30 concurrent
- **Resource Nodes**: 60 maximum (auto-cleanup at limits)
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB typical

## 🧪 Beta Testing Objectives

### Week 1 Success Criteria
- [x] Server initializes without errors
- [x] Resources spawn correctly in underwater world
- [x] Click-to-harvest works from 10 stud range
- [x] Inventory system tracks 5 items max
- [x] Save system persists between sessions
- [x] Performance stays above 30 FPS

### What to Test
1. **Resource Gathering**:
   - Can you harvest all 3 resource types?
   - Do resources respawn after 1-5 minutes?
   - Does inventory fill up at 5 items?

2. **Performance**:
   - Frame rate with multiple players?
   - Memory usage over time?
   - Any lag spikes or crashes?

3. **Persistence**:
   - Do resources save between sessions?
   - Does progress persist after leaving/rejoining?

4. **User Experience**:
   - Is the underwater environment immersive?
   - Are interactions clear and responsive?
   - Is the UI readable and helpful?

## 📊 Built-in Analytics

The system automatically tracks:
- Session length per player
- Resources gathered by type
- Crashes and performance issues
- Player feedback through in-game commands

### Console Commands (for testing)
- `/performance` - Show current server stats
- `/resources` - List active resource node count
- `/save` - Force save player data

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Week 1)
- No crafting system yet (Week 3-4)
- No building placement (Week 4)
- No multiplayer social features (Phase 1)
- Simple primitive models (will improve in later weeks)
- No sound effects beyond basic harvesting

## 🎯 Next Steps (Week 2)

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced World**: More varied terrain, better lighting
2. **Resource Improvements**: Better visual models, animations
3. **UI Polish**: Better inventory interface, tooltips
4. **Tutorial System**: Step-by-step new player guidance

### Week 2 Goals
- Improve visual quality of underwater environment
- Add resource node animations (kelp swaying, pearl glowing)
- Implement basic crafting interface
- Begin performance optimization for larger player counts

## 💾 Backup and Recovery

### DataStore Structure
Player data is saved to 3 DataStores:
- `PlayerData_Beta_v1` (Primary)
- `PlayerDataBackup_Beta_v1` (Backup)
- `PlayerDataEmergency_Beta_v1` (Emergency)

### Manual Data Recovery
If player data is lost, check DataStores in this order:
1. Primary → Backup → Emergency
2. Player data includes full session history and resource totals
